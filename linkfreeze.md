# Privacy Policy for LinkFreeze

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

## 1. Overview
LinkFreeze is a browser extension designed to help users select text within hyperlinks without triggering navigation. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles information.

## 2. Data Collection
LinkFreeze is built with a privacy-first approach.
* **Extension Usage:** The extension itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing history. All processing occurs locally on your device.
* **Store Analytics:** We use **GA4** (**Google Analytics 4**) exclusively on the Chrome Web Store listing page to understand how users find the extension. This provides aggregate, anonymous data (such as country of origin or referral source) and does not identify individual users.

## 3. Data Processing
All processing of web pages occurs locally on your device. LinkFreeze modifies the **DOM** (**Document Object Model**) of the current page only when triggered by the user to enable text selection. This data never leaves your computer.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We use **GA4** (**Google Analytics 4**) to monitor the performance of our Chrome Web Store page. 
* No **PII** (**Personally Identifiable Information**) is collected.
* IP addresses are anonymized by Google's systems before storage.
* This tracking is strictly limited to the Web Store page and does not follow your activity across the web or inside the extension's execution environment.

## 5. Permissions Justification
* **`host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`)**: Required to access and temporarily modify hyperlinks on web pages you visit, enabling text selection without navigation.
* **`contextMenus`**: Required to provide the "Bypass link to select text" option via the right-click menu.
* **`storage`**: Required to save your local preferences (custom keyboard shortcuts, enable/disable state, and excluded domains).

## 6. Contact

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We reserve the right to update this policy. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
