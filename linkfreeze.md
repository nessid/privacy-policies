# Privacy Policy for LinkFreeze

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

## 1. Overview
LinkFreeze is a browser extension designed to help users select text within hyperlinks without triggering navigation. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles information.

## 2. Data Collection
**LinkFreeze does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**
* **No User Data:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personal identifiers.
* **No Browsing History:** We do not track the websites you visit or your browsing behavior.
* **No Usage Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) to track how you use the extension.

## 3. Data Processing
All processing of web pages occurs locally on your device. LinkFreeze modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) of the current page only when triggered by the user (via shortcut or context menu) to enable text selection. This data never leaves your computer.

## 4. Third-Party Access
Since no data is collected, no data is ever shared with, sold to, or accessible by third parties.

## 5. Permissions Justification
* **`host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`):** Required to access and temporarily modify hyperlinks on web pages you visit, enabling text selection without navigation.
* **`contextMenus`:** Required to provide the "Bypass link to select text" option via the right-click menu.
* **`storage`:** Required to save your local preferences (custom keyboard shortcuts, enable/disable state, and excluded domains).

## 6. Contact

## 7. Changes to This Policy
