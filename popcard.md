# Privacy Policy for Popcard

**Popcard is a privacy-first extension.** We believe that your knowledge discovery should remain your own business.

## 1. Data Collection & Transmission
Popcard does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information, browsing history, or user data. Everything happens locally in your browser.

## 2. API Interactions
When you select text and interact with the Popcard icon, the selected word or phrase is sent directly to the official Wikimedia APIs (Wikipedia and Wikidata) to fetch relevant information. This process is triggered exclusively by user action and is not stored or recorded by the extension.

## 3. No Tracking
There are no tracking scripts, no telemetry, and no third-party analytics integrated into Popcard. We do not use cookies or any other tracking mechanisms.

## 4. Local Storage
The extension uses the `chrome.storage` API only to:
- Persist your preferences (keyboard shortcuts, domain exclusions).
- Maintain a temporary local cache of Wikipedia summaries to improve performance and reduce network load.

## 5. Third-Party Links
The extension displays content from Wikipedia. Clicking on links within the preview panel will take you to Wikipedia's website, which is governed by the Wikimedia Foundation's own privacy policy.

## 6. Contact
For any questions regarding privacy, you can contact the developer via the support tab on the Popcard page in the Chrome Web Store.
