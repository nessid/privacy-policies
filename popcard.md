# Privacy Policy for Popcard

**Popcard is designed with a strong focus on minimizing data collection.**  
However, limited and non-identifying usage data is processed in order to understand how the extension is used and to improve its functionality.

## 1. Data Collection & Transmission

Popcard itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII: Personally Identifiable Information), browsing history, or user-generated content.

All core features of the extension operate locally within the user's browser.

## 2. API Interactions

When the user selects text and interacts with the Popcard icon, the selected word or phrase is sent directly to the official Wikimedia APIs (Wikipedia and Wikidata) to retrieve relevant information.

These requests are:
- Explicitly triggered by the user.
- Not logged, stored, or reused by the extension.
- Subject to the Wikimedia Foundation’s own privacy policies.

## 3. Analytics

Popcard uses **Google Analytics (GA: Google Analytics)**, a service provided by **Google LLC**, to collect **aggregated and pseudonymous usage statistics** for the sole purpose of understanding extension usage and improving features.

The data collected via Google Analytics may include:
- Anonymous interaction events (for example: feature usage).
- Technical information such as browser type, operating system, and approximate geographic region.

Popcard does **not** use Google Analytics to:
- Track individual users.
- Collect personally identifiable information.
- Monitor browsing activity or visited pages.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

For users located in the European Union (EU), analytics data is processed under the **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** on the basis of **legitimate interest**, strictly limited to extension improvement and stability monitoring.

Where applicable, Google Analytics is configured to minimize data collection and prevent unnecessary data retention.

## 5. Data Processing by Google

Google Analytics data is processed by Google LLC in accordance with:
- Google’s Privacy Policy
- Google Analytics Terms of Service

Google may process data on servers located outside the European Union, including in the United States, under applicable data transfer safeguards.

## 6. Local Storage

The extension uses the `chrome.storage` API only to:
- Persist user preferences (for example: keyboard shortcuts, domain exclusions).
- Maintain a temporary local cache of Wikipedia summaries to improve performance and reduce network load.

No analytics data is stored locally by Popcard.

## 7. No Advertising or Profiling

Popcard does not display advertisements, perform user profiling, or share analytics data with third parties other than Google Analytics.

## 8. Third-Party Links

The extension displays content sourced from Wikipedia.  
When the user clicks a link within the preview panel, they are redirected to Wikipedia’s website, which is governed by the Wikimedia Foundation’s own privacy policy.

## 9. Contact

For any questions regarding privacy or data processing, the developer can be contacted via the support tab on the Popcard page in the Chrome Web Store.
